# Data Structure and Algorithms
Algorithms and data structures are the most integral notion in computing. They are the building blocks from which complex software is built. Having an understanding of these foundation concepts is hugely important in software design.The study of algorithms is also important because it trains us to think very specifically about certain problems. It can serve to increase our mental and problem solving abilities by helping us isolate the components of a problem and define relationships between these components.
